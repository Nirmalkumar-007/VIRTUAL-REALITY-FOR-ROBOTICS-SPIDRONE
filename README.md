### PROJECT TOPIC: 
### PRECISION SPRAYING AND SEEDING FROM THE AIR VIA AGRICULTURAL DRONES.

#### SYNOPSIS:
- Create an autonomous UAV that works using a predefined plan that can be used to spray pesticides over large agricultural land. 
- The drone is able to detect the type of areas to spray in the environment on its own. 
- Then monitor the current condition and acquire the data coming from the environment.

#### INTRODUCTION:
- In the modern world, maintaining a huge agricultural field is a major issue for humans. However, drones
can break that barrier by overtaking the responsibilities of maintaining the fields in the given context. The two
acronyms for drones are unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) and unmanned aerial systems (UAS).  
- The term UAV
means a drone, while UAS includes drones and their associated tools (e.g., flight software or cameras). Both
the UAV and UAS terms are typically used in technical and regulatory fields.
- Most drones fall under the categories of rotary or fixed-wing. A rotary-style drone would be similar to a
helicopter which is cheaper and versatile, while a fixed-wing drone looks exactly like an airplane. 
- A third type of
drone is a hybrid, which has both rotary and fixed wings. Considering the agricultural application, the Multi
copter drones are very useful to accomplish a task with a lot of advantages.
- Thermal radiation, or temperature, can be measured using longer infrared wavelengths. Plants that are
either dead or stressed should be warmer due to decreased evapotranspiration, which thermal cameras can
detect. 
- This could be useful in irrigated fields in Delaware. There are numerous claims in the agricultural drone
market that drones can be used to measure crop health. In many cases, these businesses use multispectral
data to observe how plants reflect various wavelengths of light. 
- Precision spraying and seeding from the air via
agricultural drones are our fields of development for the course of this Virtual reality for robotics. To Create
a semi-autonomous UAV that works using a predefined plan in an agricultural field for spraying applications.
Further details about the state of the art are described in detail below.
